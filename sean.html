    <p align="LEFT"> Since I began to snowboard I have always felt a certain calling to be on the mountain. 
There is nothing more exhilarating than jumping and carving down a steep mountain in the beatiful fresh air.

    Below are my three favorite snowboarders and skiiers that I am inspired by:    
<ul>
  <li>Travis Rice</li>

  <li>Jesper Tjader</li>

  <li>Tanner Hall</li>
</ul>

    Below is a rough schedule of what I have to do before hitting the mountain:

<ol>
  <li>Wake up early and take a shower</li>

  <li>Wax my board and sharpen my edges</li>

  <li>Pack my snowbag including making my lunch and snacks</li>
  
  <li>Get all my gear together</li>

  <li>Drive up the mountain towards Tahoe</li>

   <li>Get to the mountain and begin my day</li>
</ol>

I have included a list of the three ski resorts that I visit the most frequently, along with my personal opinion on the quality 
of both their trails and their terrain park.
