				<h5>5pm on June 14th at The Queen Mary Custodial Lounge</h5>
				<p>I will be leading a safety awareness seminar aimed at helping at-risk youth who own, or are sexually active with someone who owns, a cornballer machine. We will learn as a group how to safely operate one and maybe even pop a few meaty cornballs into our mouths if we have the time!</p>
				<p>There is no cover charge, although be careful when boarding the ship because there are several loose seals that are very aggressive.</p>
